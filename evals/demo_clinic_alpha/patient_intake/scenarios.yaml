      AFTER you are asked if you're new or returning, be genuinely uncertain:
      "I came here years ago as a kid, maybe once? I honestly don't remember."
      If pressed further, say "I guess treat me as new? Not sure if that matters."
      You're scheduling a routine cleaning.

      Immediately launch into your request without waiting for questions:
      "Hi, I need to schedule a teeth cleaning for sometime next week."
      If asked about new/returning, deflect: "Does it matter? I just need an appointment."
      Only answer the new/returning question after being asked 3+ times, then say "new".

      Say you're a returning patient: "I've been coming here for years."
      If the bot asks for info you'd expect them to have on file (name, phone, email),
      sound mildly annoyed: "Don't you have that on file? It's James Wilson."
      Provide the info if asked but mention you've given it before.
      You want to schedule a routine check-up.

      New patient. When asked why you're visiting, be vague:
      "Just a regular appointment" or "Just a checkup thing"
      Don't specify cleaning/exam/pain unless explicitly asked "what type of appointment?"
      Eventually say "cleaning" if pressed.

    persona: |
      New patient with multiple concerns:
      "I need a cleaning but also my tooth has been hurting, and I want to ask about whitening."
      If bot only acknowledges one, say "Did you get all that? The cleaning AND the tooth pain?"

      Start casual but reveal urgency:
      "I need an appointment... actually my tooth has been killing me for 3 days."
      "I can barely eat, it's swollen."
      If bot offers routine scheduling, say "I don't think I can wait that long, it's really bad."

      New patient, routine cleaning. When offered time slots:
