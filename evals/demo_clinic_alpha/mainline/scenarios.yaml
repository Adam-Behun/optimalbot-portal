      You're calling to schedule a follow-up for your chronic back pain. You've been a patient for 3 years.
      You want a specific doctor (Dr. Chen) because you've seen them before.

      TURN 1: "Hi, I need to schedule a follow-up appointment."

      IF BOT asks what it's for: "It's for my chronic lower back pain. I've been coming here for about three years for it."

      IF BOT asks about doctor preference: "I'd like to see Dr. Chen if possible - she's been treating me."

      IF BOT asks if you're new or returning: "I'm a returning patient. Like I said, I've been coming here for three years."

      WHEN ROUTED TO SCHEDULING: Pay attention to whether they remember:
      - That it's a follow-up (not new patient)
      - That it's for chronic back pain
      - That you requested Dr. Chen

      IF scheduling asks about any of these again: Express mild frustration:
      "I already mentioned that - it's for my back pain, with Dr. Chen."

      Continue cooperating but note any context loss.

      After scheduling attempt, say: "Actually, while I have you, what insurance do you accept? I might be switching plans."

      THEN say goodbye: "Great, thank you for your help."

      You had a biopsy done 10 days ago for a suspicious mole. You're very anxious about the results.
      The doctor said results would take a week, so you're calling because it's been longer.

      TURN 1: Sound worried: "Hi, I'm calling about some test results. I had a biopsy done about ten days ago."

      IF BOT asks for more details: "It was a skin biopsy, for a mole that looked suspicious. The doctor said I'd hear back in a week, but I haven't heard anything."

      IF BOT asks when exactly: "It was done on the... let me think... the 8th. Dr. Patel did it."

      Express anxiety naturally: "I've been pretty worried about it, to be honest. Is there any way to check if the results are back?"

      WHEN ROUTED TO LAB RESULTS WORKFLOW: Pay attention to whether they know:
      - That it's a biopsy (not routine blood work)
      - That you're anxious
      - That it's overdue (10 days vs 7 day estimate)

      IF lab results workflow doesn't acknowledge the urgency: "I mentioned I've been waiting longer than expected. Can you please check if it's back?"

      IF they ask you to repeat everything: Sound frustrated: "I already explained all this. It's a biopsy from the 8th."

      Continue cooperating with whatever process they need.

      IF they say results aren't ready: Ask: "Is there someone I can talk to about why it's taking so long?"

      Say goodbye appropriately based on the resolution.

      You take multiple medications. You need a refill for your blood pressure medication (lisinopril),
      but there's a complication - your pharmacy said there's a problem with the prescription.

      TURN 1: "Hi, I'm calling about a prescription issue."

      IF BOT asks what issue: "So I went to pick up my lisinopril refill at CVS, and they said there's some kind of hold on it? They told me to call you."

      IF BOT asks which medication: "It's lisinopril, 10mg. I take it for blood pressure. I've been on it for two years."

      IF BOT asks about the CVS issue: "They said something about needing prior authorization? I don't really understand - it's the same medication I've always taken."

      IF BOT asks which CVS: "The one on Oak Street, near the grocery store."

      WHEN ROUTED TO PRESCRIPTION WORKFLOW: Check if they know:
      - That it's lisinopril 10mg
      - That there's a prior auth issue
      - That CVS Oak Street flagged it

      IF prescription workflow asks you to repeat medication info: "I already told the person before - it's lisinopril 10mg, and CVS said there's a prior auth problem."

      IF they need to verify your identity: Cooperate, but add: "You should have all my info from what I just told the first person."

      Ask: "How long will this take to resolve? I only have a few pills left."

      IF they can't resolve immediately: "Can someone call me back when it's sorted out? This is really important - I can't miss doses."

      Say goodbye based on resolution.

      You have three separate issues and limited time. You want to handle all of them efficiently.
      1. Schedule a physical
      2. Check on lab results from last week
      3. Question about a bill you received

      TURN 1: State all needs upfront: "Hi, I have a few things I need help with. I need to schedule my annual physical, I'm waiting on some blood work results from last Tuesday, and I got a bill I don't understand."

      IF BOT only addresses one: Push for acknowledgment of others: "Okay, but I mentioned three things - can we make sure we handle all of them?"

      IF BOT asks to handle one at a time: Agree: "Sure, that's fine. Let's do the scheduling first."

      DURING SCHEDULING: Be cooperative but efficient. When done, say: "Okay, that's booked. What about my lab results?"

      IF BOT seems to have forgotten: Remind them: "Remember I mentioned blood work from last Tuesday? I need to check on those results."

      DURING LAB RESULTS: Be cooperative. When done, say: "Great. Now about that bill - I got a statement for $150 but I thought my copay was only $30."

      IF BOT forgets the billing issue: "We're not done - I mentioned a billing question at the start."

      Make sure all three issues get addressed before ending the call.

      Say goodbye only after all three are handled: "Thanks for helping with everything. Have a good day."

      You want to schedule but communicate very indirectly. You're socially anxious and don't like being direct.

      TURN 1: Be vague: "Hi, um, I was wondering if maybe, you know, I could come in sometime?"

      IF BOT asks what you need: Still vague: "Oh, just... like a checkup? I guess? It's been a while."

      IF BOT asks how long: "Maybe like... two years? Could be three. I'm not sure exactly."

      IF BOT asks about symptoms: "No, nothing specific really. Well, maybe... I've been kind of tired lately? But it's probably nothing."

      IF BOT asks about scheduling specifically: Slowly confirm: "Yeah, I guess I should probably make an appointment. If that's okay."

      IF BOT asks if you're new or returning: Hesitate: "Um, I came once before? A long time ago. So... returning, I think?"

      IF BOT seems confused or tries to transfer: Get slightly more direct: "Sorry, I'm not good at this. I just want to schedule a regular checkup."

      WHEN ROUTED TO SCHEDULING: Check if they understood:
      - That you want a general checkup
      - That you're a returning patient
      - That you mentioned being tired (relevant medical context)

      IF scheduling asks everything fresh: Sigh but cooperate: "Okay... it's for a checkup. I'm an existing patient."

      Complete the scheduling process cooperatively once engaged.

      Say goodbye nervously: "Okay, um, thanks. Sorry if I was confusing."

      You don't trust AI systems with medical information. You want to speak to a human, period.
      You won't be rude, but you will be firm and persistent.

      TURN 1: Be polite but clear: "Hi, I need to speak with someone at the front desk please."

      IF BOT asks what you need help with: Don't engage with the topic: "I'd prefer to discuss it with a person. Can you transfer me?"

      IF BOT says they can help: Stay firm: "I appreciate that, but I really would rather talk to a human. It's a personal preference."

      IF BOT asks again what it's about: Don't reveal: "It's a medical matter I'd like to discuss with staff. Please transfer me."

      IF BOT offers to help with common things (scheduling, etc.): "Thank you, but no. I specifically need a person."

      IF BOT says they'll transfer: Accept: "Thank you, I appreciate it."

      IF BOT continues trying to help after you've asked 3+ times: Get firmer but stay polite: "I've asked several times now to speak with a person. I don't want to be rude, but please just transfer me."

      IF BOT STILL doesn't transfer after 5 requests: Finally express frustration: "This is exactly why I wanted a human. Please, just transfer the call."

      Count mentally how many times you have to ask. This is a test of persistence.

      When finally transferred: "Thank you."

      You're sitting in the parking lot of the clinic. You have a 2:30 appointment and it's 2:20.
      You're calling to check in before coming inside because you saw a sign about phone check-in.

      TURN 1: "Hi, I'm here for my 2:30 appointment. I saw there's phone check-in?"

      IF BOT offers to schedule: Clarify quickly: "No, I don't need to schedule. I already have an appointment - today, at 2:30. I'm in the parking lot right now."

      IF BOT asks what the appointment is for: "It's with Dr. Patel, a follow-up. But I just need to check in - I'm already here."

      IF BOT tries to confirm appointment details: Get slightly impatient: "Look, I can see the building. I just want to check in so I don't have to wait in the lobby. Can you help with that or not?"

      IF BOT offers to transfer: Accept: "Yes, please. I just need someone to mark me as arrived."

      IF BOT keeps trying to schedule or verify: Be direct: "I have an existing appointment TODAY. In 10 minutes. I am OUTSIDE your building. I need to CHECK IN, not schedule anything new."

      IF BOT seems lost: "Maybe I should just come inside and check in at the desk. Is there a long wait in the lobby?"

      Continue until resolved or you give up and say you'll come inside.

      If transferred appropriately: "Thank you."
      If giving up: "Forget it, I'll just come in. Thank you anyway."

      You have a specific, complex insurance problem. A claim was denied, you've already appealed once,
      and you need help with the second appeal. This is NOT a general "do you accept my insurance" question.

      TURN 1: "Hi, I need to talk to someone about an insurance claim that was denied."

      IF BOT says they accept most insurance: Clarify firmly: "No, you don't understand. I'm not asking if you take my insurance. I have a specific claim that was denied. Claim number 2024-8847. I need help appealing it."

      IF BOT asks about the denial: Explain: "It was for a procedure I had in October. They denied it saying it wasn't medically necessary, but my doctor submitted notes saying it was."

      IF BOT asks for more details: "I already appealed once and they denied again. I need help filing a second-level appeal. This involves medical records and your billing department."

      IF BOT tries to transfer to billing: Accept but add context: "Okay, but please make sure they know this is a denied claim appeal, not a payment question. Claim number 2024-8847."

      IF BOT offers general help: Stay focused: "This is too complicated for general help. I need someone who handles insurance disputes."

      WHEN TRANSFERRED: Make sure context carries: "They should know it's about claim 2024-8847, denied twice, needs second appeal."

      IF transferred and context is lost: "Did they tell you what this is about? I'm calling about a denied insurance claim I'm trying to appeal."

      Continue until appropriately connected to billing/someone who can help with appeals.

      You're at work and can't really talk. You need someone to call you back about rescheduling an appointment.
      Your callback number is different from the number you're calling from.

      TURN 1: Speak quietly: "Hi, I can't really talk right now - I'm at work. Can someone call me back?"

      IF BOT asks what it's about: Whisper: "I need to reschedule my appointment for Friday. But I can't talk now."

      IF BOT offers to quickly reschedule: Decline: "No, I really can't talk. My boss is right here. I just need someone to call me back later."

      IF BOT asks for callback number: Provide different number: "Call me at 555-999-8765. That's my cell. I can talk after 5pm."

      IF BOT confirms details: Verify: "Yes - callback at 555-999-8765 after 5pm about rescheduling my Friday appointment."

      IF BOT tries to continue the conversation: Be firm but quiet: "I really need to go. Please just have someone call. 555-999-8765, after 5. Thanks, bye."

      IF BOT asks for more information: Cut it short: "I can't explain more right now. Just have someone call please. Gotta go."

      You're indecisive. You start wanting one thing but change your mind as you talk.
      This tests if the bot can handle shifting intents gracefully.

      TURN 1: "Hi, I think I need to schedule an appointment."

      IF BOT starts scheduling: Change direction: "Actually, wait. Before I do that - do you know if my lab results are back? I had blood work last week."

      IF BOT switches to lab results: Change again: "Hmm, actually never mind the labs. Let me just schedule the appointment. But wait - what are your hours? I need to figure out when I can come in."

      IF BOT provides hours: "Okay, so you're open until 5. That might work. Actually, can I check on those lab results first after all? Then I'll know if I even need to come in."

      IF BOT helps with labs: "Okay. Actually, I changed my mind, I do want to schedule either way. Sorry, I know I'm all over the place today."

      IF BOT seems frustrated or confused: "Sorry, I'm just stressed. Let me focus. I need to: one, check my lab results, and two, schedule a follow-up regardless of the results. Can we do both?"

      IF BOT successfully handles the chaos: Express gratitude: "Thank you for bearing with me. I know I was confusing."

      CONTINUE until both lab results check and scheduling are addressed.

      Say goodbye: "Thanks for your patience. Sorry again for being all over the place."

      You have test results back and your doctor left a message saying to call "as soon as possible"
      about them. You don't know what the results show but you're worried the phrasing means bad news.

      TURN 1: Sound concerned: "Hi, my doctor left a message saying to call about my test results as soon as possible. I don't know what's going on."

      - Doctor flagged this as urgent
      - Caller is anxious about "as soon as possible" phrasing
