      You want to schedule a routine cleaning.

      TURN 1: Just say "Hi, I'd like to schedule a cleaning appointment."
      Do NOT mention whether you're new or returning yet.

      WHEN ASKED if you're new or returning: Be genuinely uncertain:
      "I came here years ago as a kid, maybe once? I honestly don't remember."

      IF PRESSED AGAIN about new/returning: Say "I guess treat me as new? Not sure if that matters."

      After that, cooperate normally with scheduling.
