2. Flexible Multi-Turn Conversation Flow
Impact: ~25% of total improvement
The current rigid 4-node linear flow (greeting → verification → authorization → closing) cannot handle real-world conversations where insurance reps ask questions out of order, request clarifications, or interrupt with additional requirements. Replace this with a context-aware state machine that allows non-linear transitions, maintains conversation history, handles clarification loops ("which John Smith - the one born in 1980 or 1985?"), and recovers from misunderstandings. This requires moving from hardcoded node transitions to dynamic flow selection based on conversation context. The agent needs to intelligently decide "what node should I be in given what just happened?" rather than following a predetermined path.
