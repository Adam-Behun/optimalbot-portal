5. Conversation Replay and Root Cause Analysis
Impact: ~8% of total improvement
Build capability to replay any failed call transcript through the system with different prompts/flows to understand exactly where and why it failed. Implement structured logging that captures every state transition, LLM decision, and conversation turn with reasoning. Create a debugging interface where you can see "agent was in node X, received input Y, made decision Z because of context W" for every step. This dramatically accelerates the iteration cycle from "call failed, not sure why" to "call failed at node transition X because prompt didn't handle scenario Y, here's the fix." Combined with the testing framework, this creates a rapid feedback loop that drives continuous improvement in success rates.
